<p> in light of recent events in the social spotlight, many have become more aware of the experiences that women have faced concerning sexual harassment. 
    it is important to remember that things like this happen in everyday situations. whether we’re at school, at work, or even in public, women constantly face the danger of being sexually harassed.
    although these situations frequently occur, women often feel scared to come forward to talk about their experiences. 
    we are scared that we may face the unfair questions of “why did you let him?” or “it’s your fault”. 
    these small doses of victim blaming can lead the victim to believe that them being sexually harassed was their fault, when in fact it wasn’t. 
    therefore, it is often difficult to speak about your experience. </p>
<p> At Open Pen, our goal is to make our readers feel safe and comfortable enough to be able to share their own unjust experiences. 
    We hope that their stories will spark an inspiration that will incite bravery among people all over the country. </p>
